# JavaFxAuth

    this is a simple app that combines Spring and javaFX to perform simple login/registration with fields validation as a part of java ITIS training


    - the program is made according to the MVC pattern
    - for UI I have used JFoneix on top of FX
    - for the database I have used Postgresql
    - as part of the task it had to be finished within 2 hours only

    - the most note worthy moment in thsi mini project is how to run a JavaFX application in combination with Spring framework
